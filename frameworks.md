# [ServiceStack](https://servicestack.net/)


ServiceStack started development in 2008 with the mission of creating a best-practices services framework with an emphasis on simplicity and speed, reducing the effort in creating and maintaining resilient message-based SOA Services and rich web apps.

ServiceStack is an open-source, Microsoft .NET and Mono REST web services framework and
an alternative to the WCF, ASP.NET MVC, and ASP.NET Web API frameworks. ServiceStack is
particularly suitable for the development of REST web services.
